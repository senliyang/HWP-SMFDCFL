# HWP-SMFDCFL: Inferring Microbe-Disease Association via Higher-Order Weighted Perturbation and Dual-Channel Feature Learning Based on Similarity Matrix Fusion
A growing number of studies have demonstrated that many complex human diseases are closely associated with microbial communities. Therefore, identifying potential microbe-disease associations is of great significance for disease diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. However, traditional biomedical experiments are often costly, time-consuming, and labor-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose a novel computational model (HWP-SMFDCFL), for microbe-disease association prediction. Specifically, we introduce a new similarity matrix fusion algorithm (SMF) to integrate microbe and disease similarities. Second, a high-order weighted perturbation (HWP) technique is designed to dynamically assign weights to associations of different orders, thereby fully capturing high-order relational information. On this basis, a dual-path matrix factorization (DPMF) method is employed to reconstruct both original and high-order association matrices and extract low-dimensional linear features. Furthermore, by integrating hypergraph convolution and multilayer perceptron into a dual-channel feature learning module (DCFL), the model captures nonlinear relationships in the microbe-disease similarity network at multiple levels, thus enhancing feature representation. Finally,  deep neural network (DNN) combined with heterogeneous Newton boosting machine (HNBoost) is used to make the final predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms six state-of-the-art prediction methods. Ablation Experiments and case study further validate its effectiveness and reliability.
